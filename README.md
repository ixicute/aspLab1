This project was built as a school assignment where I got to test around a lot with asp.net core.

### Data Structure Requirements

The following are the requirements for the data structure in your program.

- [x] The company requires all staff members to be registered in a database.
- [x] Each staff member should have a leave history that includes all previous leave requests.
- [x] The leave registration should support various types of leave, such as vacation, childcare, etc.

### Functional Requirements

The following functionalities should be supported in the Console application or an MVC App.

- [x] An employee should be able to create a leave application by providing the start and end dates and selecting the type of leave. The system should automatically record the time of application submission without user input.
- [x] Implement the functionality to retrieve information about a specific person, including their name and whether they have applied for leave.
